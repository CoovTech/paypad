Back in September, Stripe launched [support for users in Canada](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-in-canada). Since then, we've had a few questions about Pay Pad's plans for doing the same.

Over the last couple of weeks, we've worked closly with a few of our users that had Stripe account in Canada and we are pleased to announce that Pay Pad for Stripe now supports both U.S. and Canadian Stripe accounts. This change applies to all iOS versions of Pay Pad for Stripe!

To get started, you don't need to do anything. Just log-in to the Pay Pad for Stripe and your account currency will automatically be detected:

When you want to create a new charge, you'll now see the account currency in the charge view:

In addition to support for the CAD currency, we've also fixed a couple of bugs that could potentially cause app crashes. We hope you enjoy the new updates!
