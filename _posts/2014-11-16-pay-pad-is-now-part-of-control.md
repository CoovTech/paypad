I am extremely excited to announce that Pay Pad is joining [Control](https://www.getcontrol.co/).

Over the past 2 years thousands of [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) merchants have helped [Pay Pad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pay-pad-for-stripe-for-iphone/id558387939?ls=1) become the most popular Stripe application for iOS. This is something that I am very proud of. 

Control is a company with an ambitious vision of what merchant tools can be. [Founder and CEO Kathryn Loewen](https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=3092434) and her team are committed to providing an outstanding tool for merchants. I will also be joining the Control team as a strategic advisor, using my experience with Pay Pad, as the CEO of [NearbyNow](http://www.nearbynow.co/), and 14 years in the finance and payments space, to help them deliver a product that helps you keep track of your online sales, and capture more revenue.

Thank you for your continued support. With the resources and talent that Control brings, I can’t wait to share our coming products with you.

Best,

Billy Coover
CEO & Founder
Pay Pad

##Who and what is Control?

[Control](https://www.getcontrol.co/) is a complete transaction reporting, analytics and management application for web and mobile.

They currently offer a variety of applications for different payment platforms and mobile devices: [Control for Stripe (Android)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.getcontrol), [Control for Paymill (iOS)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/control-for-paymill/id907627741?mt=8), and now [Pay Pad by Control (for iOS/Stripe users)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pay-pad-for-stripe-for-iphone/id558387939?ls=1).

Together we are working on a suite of integrated mobile and desktop applications that work across all major devices and all major payment providers, providing real-time reporting, analytics and management for people who collect payments online.

Control was founded and is lead by Kathryn Loewen, who has more than 15 years in the payments industry.

##Why did Control acquire Pay Pad?

Pay Pad is the most popular iOS application for Stripe merchants.

Adding this application and the expertise of the developer behind it accelerates Control’s progress toward building the ultimate tool for people who collect payments online.

##What’s going to happen to Pay Pad?

Pay Pad will continue to be offered as a stand alone application. Existing Pay Pad users will still have access to the same great features you have always had.

For new customers, Pay Pad will now be available for free download for a limited time trial. Once the trial period is over, you can choose from a range of plans to suit your business needs.

##What does this mean for existing Pay Pad customers?

An updated version of Pay Pad will be available for you to download over the next few days. You will get a beautiful new design which makes using Pay Pad an even more fantastic experience.

In addition, you will get access to the fantastic support that Control offers all of their customers.

Over the coming months we will be adding further functionality to the application, and eventually offering you the chance to upgrade (with a special offer) to our complete payments management application. If you are interested in being one of the first to trial this new product, [let us know](https://www.getcontrol.co/desktop-app).

##Will Pay Pad continue to be a stand alone app?

For the time being, yes.

As we continue to develop our merchant tools we may re-evaluate this, but all existing customers will continue to have access to Pay Pad.
