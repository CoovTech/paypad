excerpt:
  One of the most common questions people have about Pay Pad for Stripe is "does it do push notifications?". I'm excited to finally be able to say YES!

##Analytics
With the Pay Pad dashboard, you'll get instant insight into the health of your Stripe account. See how you are doing today, as well as week-to-date and month-to-date roll-ups. You also get an account overview that shows grand totals of all your activity. 

We've also got beautiful charts for revenue over the last seven days, weekly revenue over the last 13 weeks, monthly revenue over the last 12 months, all revenue to date, and cumulative revenue to date.


##Real-time
If you are an existing Pay Pad user, you don't have to do anything. You automatically have the dashboard with all your historic Stripe data aggregated and displayed in beautiful charts and graphs.

If you are new to Pay Pad, it can take anywhere from a few seconds to a minute to build your dashboard, depending on how active your Stripe account is.

Your dashboard stays up-to-date and accurate.

##Multi-account & Multi-currency support!
Pay Pad was the first mobile Stripe app to support multi-currency and multi-account and the new dashboard does too! As Stripe expands it's awesome product world-wide, you can count on Pay Pad to support new currencies, even during BETA phases.

##More to come
We've been working hard to make the analytics dashboard as useful as possible. This first version focuses mostly on revenue. The next version, already in BETA testing, adds more detail around customers and transfers and will have some areas that will be interactive.

We are also working on an advanced analytics version that we are really excited about. A lot of people have asked for churn and revenue forecasting. We've been working hard to make that happen and it will be BETA testing the new reports soon!
