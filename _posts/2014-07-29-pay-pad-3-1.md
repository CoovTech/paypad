excerpt:
  Customer need a receipt? We've got you covered.

One of the most requested features we've seen over the past few months is support for email receipts.

It makes a lot of sense when you think about it. Your customer is handing you their credit card, a major sign of trust, and then you
scan the card and go on your merry way. Wait a sec? What just happened here?

##One-tap Receipts!

With Pay Pad 3.1, we've added a simple toggle switch that allow you to choose to send a customer a reciept if you'd like.
It's subtle, stays out of your way, but very easy to use.

The receipt feature has some smarts built into it as well. If you charge an existing customer with an email address, you'll
notice that the email receipt field is pre-filled out and ready for you to send. *I'm so Fancy!*

##Currency Conversions

Another popular feature request from our global multicurrency customers is to show the currency conversion when looking at a charge.

The way this works is straight-forward. When you open a charge to look at the detail behind it we detect if the charge was accepted in a current that is
different from your account's base currency. If it is, we kindly GET/ the conversion information from Stripe and display it along side the actual charge currency.

Hope you enjoy!
