One of the most common questions people have about Pay Pad for Stripe is "does it do push notifications?". I'm excited to finally be able to say YES!

So how does it work you ask? Simple! Upgrade to [version 1.2.0](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pay-pad-for-stripe-for-iphone/id558387939?ls=1), tap yes when prompted if you want to receive push notifications, and then login with your [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) account. That's it, you are automagically connected!

##Cha-Ching!
Push notifications are great, but what's even better than that? Making money! This was the inspiration for the "Cha-Ching" sound of a cash register closing as a successful charge notification is pushed to you. All `charge.succedded` events will make the cash register sound while everything else will use the default Apple push notification sound.

##Multi-account support?
With Pay Pad for Stripe you can use any Stripe account you want. The ability to manage multiple accounts without having to logout and back in is a feature we are working on; we know the experience today is not ideal. The good news is that you'll get push notifications for any Stripe account you connect to from Pay Pad!

##An added bonus
If you are an [Alerts for Stripe](http://www.pay-pad.com/alerts) customer, you can manage these push notifications the same way you currently manage your email and SMS alerts from Stripe. So if your current settings are configured to only notify you for new payments larger than $100, the push notifications will also honor that setting!
