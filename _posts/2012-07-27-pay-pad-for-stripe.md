excerpt:
  We believe that it should be simple to keep track of your business financials no matter where you are. As small business owners, we aren't always around a computer. We might be at a coffee shop, on a golf course, in a meeting, or on a plane. Keeping track of real-time financials should not require us to be tied to an office.

Pay Pad for Stripe is the first iPad app built for the [Stripe](http://www.stripe.com) API.

We believe that it should be simple to keep track of your business financials no matter where you are. As small business owners, we aren't always around a computer. We might be at a coffee shop, on a golf course, in a meeting, or on a plane. Keeping track of real-time financials should not require us to be tied to an office.

For us mobile business professionals, we need the ability to accept payments while on the go, in addition to keeping track of our daily transactions. Some great solutions already exist for accepting mobile payments. We can can get a fancy dongle and swipe cards on our smart phones and that's really neat, but what if you have an established online ecommerce site that's already connected to Stripe? Wouldn't it be great to have access to that same account from anywhere in the U.S., and accept payments using that same account?

Pay Pad for Stripe puts your Stripe account in your messenger bag (we prefer [these](http://www.timbuk2.com)). 

##Features  
- Charges: You can view your recent charges and get a quick view of their status. Paid, failed, refunded, it's all there.  
- Refunds: You can refund a charge right from the charges view. You can also refund a customer's charge from the customer view.  
- Customers: View your recent customers and see their charge history.  
- Transfers: Keep track of the money deposited into your bank account from the transfers view.  
- Logs: There are a lot of moving parts with transactions and the log view lets you view the most recent log activity.  
- Security: Pay Pad for Stripe is built on top of the Stripe Platform and uses OAuth to authenticate with Stripe. This means that you get the same great comfort and security from Stripe with out the hassle of working about complex PCI requirements.

##Coming Soon...
Pay Pad for Stripe is great for activley managing your Stripe account, but if you are like us, you need to delegating the monitoring of that account management because you are far too busy to watch it like a stock ticker. After all, you're not going to be swiping through your recent charges on the back-nine of your local TPC (just the front-nine). 

We've built an active account monitoring system that keeps track of important events on your Stripe account and will send you Email and/or SMS alerts when one of those events is triggered. For example, let's say that you want to be notified every time a chargeback happens on your Stripe account. No problem, you can configure chargeback alerts to be delivered via SMS so you know right away what's going on. Need to send those chargebacks to someone in the back-office to investigate? Just configure the alert for email and setup an auto-forward rule on your email client. It's that simple!

The notification system is in early Alpha testing right now and should move to Beta soon!
