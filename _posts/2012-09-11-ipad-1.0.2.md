##Changes

Don't be intimidated by the number of changes. We are confident you'll be comfortable with this upgrade.

Here's what has changed:  

- OAuth improvements  
- Device information is now sent to our servers for Alerts for Stripe users  

There you go! Whew, glad you survived that upgrade.

##All joking aside

So in addition to improving the OAuth experience, we've also added a new feature that more tightly integrates Pay Pad for Stripe with Alerts for Stripe. 

Don't have an [Alerts for Stripe](http://www.pay-pad.com/alerts) account? You should. But if you don't, no worries. We now send the make, model, iOS version, and friendly name of your device over to the Alerts for Stripe app. Nothing sensitive like UDID goes; just information we thought would be useful to you. 

So why do this? Glad you asked! We've been working hard on push notifications Pay Pad for Stripe both the iPad version and the soon-to-be-blessed-by-apple iPhone version. When an interesting event occurs on your Alerts for Stripe account, we will optionally send a push notification (in addition to SMS and email) to any devices that you have the Pay Pad for Stripe app installed on. We are also going to provide admin tools for Alerts for Stripe that will enable you to configure which devices will receive alerts. Want to skip the iPad push notification but have it sent to your iPhone? You've got it.

Upgrade today, it's simple.
