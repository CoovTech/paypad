Pay Pad 3.0 is loaded with awesome new features and a new look and feel for iOS 7. We've made some 
infrastructure changes that improve the speed in which your data loads, and we've fixed some bugs along the way.

Here's a look at the major new features of Pay Pad 3.0:

##Card Reader Support

One of our most requested features has been support for card readers. We looked at several options and most 
were cost prohibitive. We found Card.io, an easy and intuitive way to scan a credit card via your iPhone or iPad 
camera. It's simple, fast, and very accurate. No dongle required!

##Create New Customers

We've added the ability to create new customers directly from your device. You can also choose an existing plan 
to add the customer to (if you are adding a credit card), and you can apply a coupon as well. We've tried to make 
this as intuitive as possible. The form is short and sweet and it only takes a couple of taps to create your new 
customer.

##Full Multi-currency Support

Pay Pad has always supported multiple currencies when displaying charges. Now that Stripe has enabled some multicurrency 
customers to charge in a variety of currencies, we've added support for that too. Now, when you go to accept a payment 
and you have a multicurrency account, we let you choose the currency that you'd like to accept the payment in.
