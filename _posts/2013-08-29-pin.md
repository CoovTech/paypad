You asked for it and now you have it!

![Pay Pad for Stripe with Pin Support](http://f.cl.ly/items/2J0w1n3d3V2q011m3h0k/pin.jpg)

##Simple Security
We wanted to make this feature simple to use. It stays out of your way if you don't want it, and it protects your Stripe accounts if you do.

Getting started is easy. Simply go to the settings view, tap the toggle switch for the security pin, then do your thing.

Enjoy!
