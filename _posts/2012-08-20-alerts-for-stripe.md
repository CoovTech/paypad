title: "Introducing Alerts for Stripe"
excerpt:
  When we built [Pay Pad for Stripe](http://www.pay-pad.com), we loved that we could literally touch our Stripe account. It was great to have the ability to manage charges and customers right from the device. But something was missing... We don't always have our iPad with us but important things still happen to our account all day long. We needed a way to be notified in real-time when something important happened to our Stripe account.

When we built [Pay Pad for Stripe](http://www.pay-pad.com), we loved that we could literally touch our Stripe account. It was great to have the ability to manage charges and customers right from the device. But something was missing... We don't always have our iPad with us but important things still happen to our account all day long. We needed a way to be notified in real-time when something important happened to our Stripe account.

##Alerts for Stripe

We created [Alerts for Stripe](http://www.pay-pad.com/alerts) to be a simple Stripe account monitoring service that will email or send you a text message any time something important happens to your account. For example, lets say that you have a product or service that you charge for monthly. Your customers are important to you and you want to provide ROCKSTAR customer service like Zappos. Unfortunately you like the time, resources, and ability to keep track of everything in real-time. You can configure Alerts for Stripe to send you a text message, and an email, when one of your valuable customers closes their account. Now you are in the loop. Now you can reach-out to that customer quickly and find out what went wrong. You ARE an instant ROCKSTAR customer service professional.
