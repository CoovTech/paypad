That's right, we've just launched the iPhone version; download it today!

When we launched the iPad app in July, we recevied a lot of questions, but they were all the same: **"Is there an iPhone version?"**

Well, it turns out that there are more people that have iPhones than iPads *(side note, we need to fire our market research analyst)*; so we built an iPhone version.

We really wanted to compile the iPad app as a universal app so that we could quickly get an iPhone into your hands but that fancy swipe interface on the iPad feels wrong on the iPhone. So we did what any young bootstrapped side-project of a company would have done and we lit up the Bat Signal hoping for some design help. Batman never showed, but [Cory Watilo](http://watilo.com/pages/about) did.

If you don't know Cory (you should), he's an awesome designer out of Orange Country (the cool one). If you've used any of the custom [Posterous](https://posterous.com/) themes, it's likely that you are using one of his designs (he created the [best ones](http://themes.posterous.com/); we are biased). He's also one of the founders of [FolioHD](http://foliohd.com/), a beautiful site for photographers, designers, and anyone else who wants to showcase their creative talent online.

The iPad version does not have a top navigation bar so we didn't have to design one. The iPhone app does and we wanted the it to look and feel like a native Stripe app. After all, Stripe is simple, so using a Stripe iPhone app should be too. Cory was able to build us a custom navigation bar and navigation menu that really pops when you are sliding views around. The app has a nice native look and feel to it and we could not have accomplished that without Cory's  help. Thank you sir!

##Features

The features in the iPhone version are the same as the iPad version with a couple exceptions. We've improved performance and are caching more aggressivley which helps keep the app snappy for you. We've also added pull-to-refresh on all list views so that you can obsess over your data in real-time. Here's the feature list:  

-  View your recent charges, drill-in to see the detail for each charge including fees and status!  
-  View your recent customers, drill-in to see the customer detail and see specific charges for that customer!  
-  View your bank account transfers including pending transactions!  
-  See your Stripe account event log for the last 30 days!  
-  Create new charges on the fly!  
-  Add charges to your existing customers!  
-  Refund one-off charges and customer charges!  
-  Pay Pad uses OAuth to authenticate with Stripe. We can't see your account credentials so you can rest easy that your Stripe account stays safe and secure!  

##What's next?
We have plenty of work to do to make this a full-featured Stripe app and that's our plan. In the short-term our top priority is push notifications and tight integration with [Alerts for Stripe](https://www.pay-pad.com/alerts), and a more robust drill-down experience when looking at a charge (example: open a charge, see and drill-into the related customer details).

##Share your feedback
You asked for an iPhone app so we built it. What do you want next? We'll probably build anything or add any feature as long as it doesn't end in "berry".
